## Install
First you need to clone this repository and move `gas-menu.el` file to your load path and add the following code to your Emacs config file:

```elisp
(require 'gas-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.asm\\'" . gas-mode))
```

Now each time you open a file with `.asm` extension, **gas-mode** will be use automatically.
